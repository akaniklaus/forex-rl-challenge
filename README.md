# FX Reinforcement Learning Playground

This repository contains an open challenge for a Portfolio Balancing AI in Forex.

The state of the FX market is represented via 512 features in X_train and X_test.

These 512 features summarizes the price-actions of 10+1 assets in past 10 days.

Hourly log returns of assets during train & test periods are in y_train and y_test.

Why use my features as environment summary? because they're performing well!

# Participation into the Forex RL Challenge
**example.py** contains an implementation, which balances a long-short FX portfolio.

Up to 2x leverage is allowed. Your objective is to outperform following risk metrics.

Please send me your saved model so that I can test it on a blind set for the contest.

I will list results from challengers here by sorting them using the industry-standard

risk measures including (but not limited to) the Calmar, Sortino, Omega ratio(s), etc.

# Test results of example.py available here:
Max. Drawdown: 2.81% 
Sortino Ratio: 6.91x

Sharpe Ratio: 2.62x 
Stability: 93.31% 

Tail Ratio: 1.85x 
Value at Risk: -0.55%

# Test results that I have obtained myself:
Max. Drawdown: 4.94% 
Sortino Ratio: 8.72x

Sharpe Ratio: 3.10x 
Stability: 94.78% 

Tail Ratio: 2.78x 
Value at Risk: -0.75%

# How you can get rich out of this?
If you obtain successful results and you want to use your RL model for live-trading,

you can contact me for subscribing to a real-time feed of the environment summary.

Your objective results here can also attract business opportunities such as job offers.


# If you are interested in academics:
Are you an academician? Use FX RL challenge to experiment with it in your publication.

You won't need to worry about the right feature extraction, as I already did that for you.

Fixed input for challengers will allow a clear benchmarking of RL methods developed.

Below is a survey paper about reinforcement learning applications in financial markets.

# Sponsorships and Hackhathons

Please, contact me if you would like to sponsor the FX RL challenge; or organize a local

meetup, workshop or Hackathon where RL practitioners can participate to this challenge. 

# Bonus: Example Implementation
PyTorch implementation of Multi-processed training of a shared model where batches

are divided across processes. Looking for a person to contribute a TensorFlow version,

as well as an Open AI Gym environment to realistically simulate live-trading conditions.
